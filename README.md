# MachineLearning
Machine Learning class final project at University of Washington
Ever since the introduction of video poker games, computers are explicitly programmed to recognize poker hands using Genetic Algorithms. Due to the simple nature of poker games, itâ€™s trivial for humans to validate poker hand rules. This paper discusses the possibility of recognizing poker hands using machine learning algorithms. The dataset includes a list of poker hands. Each data instance is a sample poker hand consisting of five poker cards from a uniform deck of 52 (Excluding 2 jokers). Each card is represented using two attributes, suit and rank, for a total of 10 predictive attributes. At the end of each instance, there is one Class label that represents the poker hand scores. There are 10 Class labels, ranging from Nothing in hand to Royal flush. The goal of my research is to predict class labels for each data instance using classification methods, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine. In addition, K Fold Validation is implemented in order to improve performance.
